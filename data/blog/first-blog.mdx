## Let's Get the Ball Rolling

Welcome to the first of many amateur thinkpieces that no one has asked for, yet the desire to do so has been bubbling up.

Shall we?

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Let's Get the Ball Rolling" />

## Who am I?

Quite an intrusive, demanding question to start.

Professionally, I'm a _Lead Software Engineer_ at Herzog, building software applications within the railroad industry.

Semi-professionally (based on the amount of hours I spend doing it, not by any actual designation), I'm a _runner_.

It's easy to identify with those two first given the amount of they take up in my waking hours. It's a bit more difficult to identify with the aspects of myself that led me to those, but that answer could be tied to what led me to creating this website.

We all have an innate desire to create, progress, and share. From the technology news/developments that interest me, the running tips I've come across, the ups and downs of the journey, and everything in-between, there may be a post about it here.

That's what this will be, glad you're here.

## So what now?

Stay tuned for some of my discoveries, thoughts, and creations.
